# DeepFake-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project showcases an advanced deepfake detection pipeline that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). It leverages EfficientNet-B0 for spatial feature extraction and BiLSTM for capturing temporal dependencies across video frames.
